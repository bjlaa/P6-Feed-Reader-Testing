Hi,

This project's goal is to test some functionalities of the app Feed Reader. To do this the library Jasmine.js was used.

In order to check if the tests pass, open index.html with your favorite web browser and check on the bottom page. Green means pass. Red means doesn't pass.

Check out Jasmine.js: http://jasmine.github.io/
